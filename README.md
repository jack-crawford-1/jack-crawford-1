I'm currently developing a full stack hiking app to expand my skills in web development, while creating a useful tool that provides detailed trail information, event coordination, and community engagement features. It's a practical application of my technical abilities, showcasing my problem-solving skills and commitment to continuous learning. And a good excuse to spend time planning future hikes!
